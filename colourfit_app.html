            <h2>About Colourfit</h2>
            <p>Colourfit is a mobile app designed to assist the vision-impaired individuals and those struggling with
                color differentiation in their outfit choices. Using a skin tone
                and hair color scan, it suggests clothing colors that complement the user. </p>
            <p><strong>My Role:</strong>As the Design Lead for Colourfit, I delegated the tasks, hosted design meetings,
                and facilitated the seamless handoff of design assets and specifications to our development team,
                ensuring a cohesive and efficient workflow throughout the project lifecycle.I created the mockup designs
                and UI kit, supervised wireframe and user flow creation, and steered the overall visual direction. My
                aim was to craft an intuitive and cohesive user experience, focusing on making color and outfit
                experimentation accessible and enjoyable for users.
            </p>

            <h2>Understanding User Needs</h2>
            <p> Our approach involved a deep dive into the experiences of vision-impaired users and those facing
                color-related challenges. We conducted interviews, surveys, and user testing to comprehend their
                struggles, frustrations, and aspirations. This guided the development of a user-centric solution.
            </p>

            <h2>Competitive Edge</h2>
            <p>Colourfit's uniqueness lies in its ability to scan outfits, provide tailored color suggestions based on
                skin tones, and enable easy outfit organization through personalized closets. This sets it apart from
                other applications, emphasizing both inclusivity and user convenience.</p>

            <p>Our target audience spans diverse age groups and genders, focusing on those with color-related challenges
                and vision impairments. The design process revolved around ensuring accessibility, simplicity, and

            <h2>User Flow</h2>
            <p>The app's user flow guides users through a simple process: scanning skin tone and hair colour and
                receiving personalized color combinations four outfits. It's designed to be straightforward and
                enjoyable,
                aiming to help users easily experiment with different colours.</p>

            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p>
                The black and white “o” represents the experience of individuals with visually impairement, it
                symbolizes
                their perspective and serves as a visual representation. By incorporating a colorful “o” alongside the
                black and white one, I acknowledged that Colourfit is an inclusive brand that caters to both
                visually impaired individuals and those who can perceive colors. The contrasting colours helps create a
                visual distinction between elements, making the logo more accessible to everyone. This contrast also
                interprets as a metaphor for the transformative power of Colorfit.

            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>
                Indivisible and SF Pro Display are two contemporary sans-serif fonts that harmonize seamlessly.
                Indivisible
                have sharp edges and a clean, modern aesthetic. SF Pro Display’s rounded edges and polished appearance
                lead to
                a professional and sophisticated look, enhancing accessibility and readability for everyone.

            </div>

            <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
            <p>The app utilizes a color palette consisting of five vibrant colors as accent and a black-and-white scheme
                for
                primary colours. This choice of colors aims to ensure high contrast and improved visibility, catering to
                all
                users, including those with color blindness or visual impairments, enabling them to efficiently perceive
                information and navigate through the interface. Primary colours black and white helps maintain a strong
                contrast,
                allowing users to easily distinguish different elements and buttons, thus enhancing overall
                accessibility and user
                experience.

            <h2>Illustrations</h2>
            <p>
                I have created all illustrations using illustrator and Photoshop.The illustrations, ranging from
                clothing placeholders to memojis, were designed to enhance engagement and clarity within the app. These
                visual aids serve as both informative placeholders and personalized user avatars, augmenting the overall
                experience.
            </p>

            <h2>UI Elements</h2>
            In the interface displaying colors, skin tone, texture, and clothing types alongside the color swatches, I
            ensured that color names were consistently present. For better interaction, I used two ways to show users
            how they could interact with the app. For instance, in the navigation bar, I enlarged and highlighted icons
            with a colorful stroke to enhance accessibility. Check out all of
            the UI Kit <a

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the designs, wireframes were structured to offer guidance without overwhelming users by
                sectioning the contents and creating hierarchy. Check out all of our <a

            <p>
                In the mockups my first priority was accessibility by implementing

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Adherence to Best Practices and incorporating Accessibility:</strong> Understood the value of
                adhering to industry best practices, emphasizing
                user-centered design, accessibility
                standards, and iterative testing to ensure a seamless and inclusive user experience. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Collaboration Dynamics: </strong> Trusting collaboration was key throughout the
                project.Embracing a collaborative
                approach with both developers and designers involved consistent communication, continual
                feedback, and iterative adjustments to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly outcome.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Design-to-Development Transition:</strong> The design to development transition taught me the
                importance of clear
                communication, detailed design specifications and maintaining design documentation for a seamless
                handover.
