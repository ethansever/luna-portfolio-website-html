            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <ul class="numbered-list">
                <li>Lack of Hierarchy: Even though the page has two different levels of header, there isn't any distinction among
                    them. Both of them use the same font size and weight. Lack of hierarchy is addressed by fixing font sizes.
                </li>
                <li>Lack of Consistency: Height between input field and dropdown is identical in the other pages on the game. But
                    in
                    Set Profile Background Page they are inconsistent with each other. And the tracking of the dropdown texts are
                    not
                    matching with the rest of the UI Kit and typography. This is fixed by changing tracking to be inline with the
                    rest
                    of the pages and equalizing the heights of the containers.</li>
                <li>Lack of Sorting & Categorization: In the Dropdown the choices given to players are either sorted by purchase
                    date
                    decreasing or alphabetically increasing. But in LoL, sometimes older skins are way cooler to showcase since
                    they
                    are more rare. If a user wanted to pick an older skin, they have to scroll all the way down to be able to
                    pick.
                    This problem is addressed by adding more options to dropdown and adding separate navigation for distinguishing
                    between skins and defaults/classics of the characters.</li>
                <li>Lack of Distinction: Save button and restore defaults button are used side by side with little to no
                    distinction
                    among each other. To eliminate this they used the hover effect on Save Button at all times which confuses the
                    players even more because of their learned behaviors. I have added the restore default button with two
                    choices,
                    and conducted preference testing to decide the final option.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reference points</h2>
            <div class="project-work">
                <img loading="lazy" alt="referencepoint" srcset="/images/projects/lolclient/referencepoint@2x.png 1x,
                        /images/projects/lolclient/referencepoint@2x.png 2x,

                    src="/images/projects/lolclient/referencepoint@3x.png">
            </div>

            <h2>Reference points explained</h2>
            <ul class="alphabet-list">
                <li>Lack of Hierarchy: Formerly “Restore Defaults” had a smaller icon button version . But with the new updates it
                    has
                    been removed. And yet not replaced with anything else that corresponds. Instead there is one new function
                    added
                    which you can delete an icon by dragging, this function only deletes the emote from the player's “shown”
                    emotes.
                    This could confuse players because the player's thought process can be “if they drag it to the trashcan icon,
                    their remote will be deleted permanently”. This thought is a learned behavior for players, in many aspects of
                    UI,
                    files are dragged to the trash can to be deleted from that respected path the user is in. But in this LoL
                    Client's
                    case, they are not permanently deleted rather deleted from that shown page and can be replaced.</li>
                <li>This page shows the players their customizable identity page, this will be my reference point for creating a
                    first
                    & second header and search & filter bar for “Set Profile Background” Page.</li>
                <li>In the client's “Settings” Page, my reference points were “restore defaults” and “Done” button placements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These reference points were taken into account to create new pages inline and synchronous with the rest of the user
                interfaces. And by having reference points, I wanted to take into account the players previous interactions with
                the
                interface.
            </p>

            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p>Lack of hierarchy is addressed by fixing font sizes. Input field boxes and dropdown containers heights are
                rearranged
                and tracking of the dropdown texts are matched with the rest of the user interface and typography. Lack of Sorting
                &
                Categorization is addressed by adding more options to dropdown and adding separate navigation for distinguishing
                between skins and defaults/classics of the characters.</p>
            <p>To eliminate lack of distinction, I have added the restore default button with two choices, and conducted
                preference
                testing to decide the final option.

            </div>

            <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
            <p>I have added the restore default button with two choices, and conducted preference testing to decide the final
                option
                to see which UI version does players choose. Preference Testing is done with recurrent players of the game, the
                restriction of counting as recurrent players were set as minimum 3 hours of game time per week. The problem was
                close
                CTA buttons which are confusing the users. “A” option contained design fixes addressed with the “Reset Defaults”
                icon
                button placed in the upper right corner. Option “B”, was the “Restore Defaults” text version of the button added
                in
                the upper right corner. The control was “C” , the interface currently implemented in the page. <br>The test
                consisted
                of twelve people, the participants asked whether they choose A, B or C options. Option A had selection rate of 50%
                ,
                Option B had 33% and control Option C got 17%.</p>
            <p>With this result I have addressed one more page which is emote page, this page formerly had icon version of restore
                defaults but with update it was removed. I have reimplemented restore defaults to the emotes page.</p>

            <div class="project-work">
                <img loading="lazy" alt="Emotes 1" srcset="/images/projects/lolclient/Emotes 1@2x.png 1x,
                            /images/projects/lolclient/Emotes 1@2x.png 2x,
                            /images/projects/lolclient/Emotes 1@3x.png 3x" src="/images/projects/lolclient/Emotes 1@3x.png">
            </div>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In summary, user experience challenges were addressed by fixing the confusion around headers , changing containers
                for
                consistency, decreasing time spent by adding dropdown options and navigation. Lastly to increase user engagement,
                restore default function's placement have been changed. This changes will help the LoL client to be more inline
                and
                cohesive across other pages of the UI.</p>
